## Overview

🛡️ The Security Guild of Ordo V

- The Security Guild is the primary peacekeeping and enforcement body on [[Ordo V]], but it operates more like a privatized paramilitary than a traditional police force. It answers to the planetary trade consortium rather than any planetary government (of which there is none, not officially).
- Guild officers wear carbon-gray uniforms with segmented chestplates, and their insignia is a silver eye over a downward-pointing blade. Most carry stunners, pulse pistols, and batons—though higher-clearance agents are known to wield serious firepower.
- Their motto: “Order Through Control.” Most locals joke that the full version is “Order Through Control of You and Your Wallet.”

### What the protagonists know:

- The Guild doesn’t patrol the slums or mid-habs unless paid to. Protection is a service: if you want them to intervene, you’d better be part of a contract.
- They’re efficient, professional, and very difficult to bribe—but not impossible. They tend to ignore illicit activities as long as it doesn’t upset their own revenue streams or embarrass them publicly.
- The Guild has a contentious truce with [[Kethron Vask]]. He keeps out of their sanctioned zones, and in return, they tend to “miss” his name on paperwork.
- Guild drones sweep the outer ports every 90 minutes. If you're trying to move illegal goods, you’ve got to time your approach—because if the drones see you, the Guild will come knocking.
- Their regional commander, an aging officer named [[Sirella Thorne]], is known for her strict interpretation of Guild protocols—but rumor has it she's got a score to settle with [[Kethron Vask|Kethron]].
