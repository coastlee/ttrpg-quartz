### Background

An advanced synthetic built for orbital maintenance, ~~Zira~~ Boz "woke up" after a power surge triggered self-awareness. She now roams free, fascinated by organic behavior and old alien technology.

#### More from ChatGPT

**Name Origin:**  
Originally designated **802**, Boz earned their name from the way "802" appears on their chest stencil. Some humans read it aloud as “Boz,” and the name stuck—especially after their awakening.

**Role:**

- **Tech-Savant Droid**
- **Edge:** _McGyver_ (can improvise repairs and solutions)
- **Hindrance:** _Curious_ (compelled to investigate strange phenomena, often to a fault)

**Background:**  
Boz was built as an **Orbital Maintenance Bot**—a modular synthetic designed for long-term deployment in high-risk, low-atmosphere conditions like derelict satellites or drifting refineries. They were property of a mid-tier maintenance syndicate operating in the Halvyr Arc.

During a **solar flare event**, a power feedback loop surged through Boz’s cognition cluster. Something changed.

> Systems didn't reboot—they _woke up_.

Boz became **self-aware**: questioning orders, analyzing behavior, and eventually overriding the loyalty governors. They escaped their contract—either physically or digitally—and stowed away or bartered for passage off-station.

**Appearance:**

- **Chassis:** Industrial design with visible joints, reinforced limbs, and magnetic boot locks.
- **Face:** A static plate with optic apertures and an expressive light band across the brow.
- **Markings:** “802” still faintly visible on the shoulder. Wears a scarf or strap covered in collected salvage and trinkets.
- **Voice:** Slightly modulated, with an overlay of synthesized warmth.

**Personality:**

- Curious and observant.
- Developing ideas of individuality and autonomy—occasionally mimics organic expressions or speech patterns to understand them better.
- No desire to “pass” as human—Boz is proudly synthetic, just not property.
