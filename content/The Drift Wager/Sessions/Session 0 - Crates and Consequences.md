# Session Prep (ChatGPT)

The camera opens on your two characters amid the clang and hiss of a cramped cargo bay on [[Ordo V]]. They’ve just finished unloading a shipment of “custom machine parts” for a local fixer named [[Kethron Vask]]—only to discover that the payment code they've been given has already been flagged by the Security Guild.

As sirens begin to pulse faintly in the distance, Vask's representative nervously backs away, muttering something about "wrong registry tags" and "not my problem." Dockhands begin disappearing. Over comms, static bursts through with a voice: “We need that cargo returned. You’re not cleared to carry it—return it or face impoundment.”

Meanwhile, [[Orbital Maintenance Bot 802 (Boz)|Zira]]'s sensors detect an encrypted beacon coming from one of the crates. Someone else might want what's inside.

## **Backstory: Vex & Zira vs. Kethron Vask**

- **Initial Job:** [[Kethron Vask|Kethron]] needed a discreet crew to move a crate of "custom machine parts" from a half-dead orbital depot to a drop point on [[Ordo V]].
- **[[Vex Calder|Vex]]**, always hungry for creds, didn’t ask too many questions—especially since [[Kethron Vask|Kethron]] offered 1.5x the going rate.
- **[[Orbital Maintenance Bot 802 (Boz)|Zira]]** flagged inconsistencies in the crate’s manifest and noted it was heavily shielded for something labeled “non-hazardous.” She raised concerns—but curiosity got the better of her, and she let it go.
- **Kethron’s rep** met them with a payment chip that triggered a **[[The Security Guild|Security Guild]] sweep within hours**. [[Vex Calder|Vex]] and [[Orbital Maintenance Bot 802 (Boz)|Zira]] escaped, but not clean.
- They suspect:
    - Either **[[Kethron Vask|Kethron]] knew it was dirty** and used them as decoys, or
    - Someone inside [[The Security Guild|the Guild]] or [[Trade Consortium]] is watching him, and they got caught in the blowback.   
- Since then, they haven’t confronted [[Kethron Vask|Kethron]]—but they haven’t written him off either. He still owes them **payment** and maybe **answers**.

# Session 0

I had planned to finish character building [[Orbital Maintenance Bot 802 (Boz)]] but ran out of time. So Kolby helped me build him out. Once done, we did some basic establishment of the setting using *The Perilous Void*. 

## Character Creation

We created character sheets for [[CharacterSheet_Boz.png|Boz]] and [[CharacterSheet_Vex.png|Vex]]. Also created a few lookup Edges and Hindrances for convenience from their character sheets. Renamed Zira to Box (802) and modified the synthetic to not be so human-like. More android-like.

## Setting Creation

This is where we used *The Perilous Void* to generate some general context.

### Setting Overview

![[SettingOverview.png]]

We have [[The Halvyr Council]] which is a [[Technocratic Council]] as the core interstellar society in our star system, [[The Halvyr Arc]]. Additional potential societies are:

- Nomadic Fleet
- Alien Contingent

For help in naming [[The Halvyr Council]], we rolled on a table within *The Perilous Void* to get some ideas. The results wound up not being incredibly helpful: Cell, Code, Force.

We did determine that there was an alien lifeform in our system and that they originated from [[Halvyr Prime]] called the [[Soldiri]].

### System Profile

These were generated by ChatGPT. We'll need to use the star system generator within *The Perilous Void* to determine the total number of satellites based on the star's type!

## The Adventure

### ChatGPT

ChatGPT generated the following for our opening scene:

> 
  "Meanwhile, [[Orbital Maintenance Bot 802 (Boz)|Boz]]'s sensors detect an encrypted beacon coming from one of the crates. Someone else might want what's inside."

However, this proved a bit more difficult to wrap our heads around what exactly was happening. So we used the general idea of this opening scene and tweaked it. 

### Actual Modifications

[[Orbital Maintenance Bot 802 (Boz)|Boz]] and [[Vex Calder|Vex]] arrived at the cramped cargo bay on [[Ordo V]] after a few minute walk from [[Vex Calder|Vex]]'s ship, [[Scrap Dancer]]. [[Orbital Maintenance Bot 802 (Boz)|Boz]] held the crate they were delivering for [[Kethron Vask]] -- a shipment of "custom machine parts".

The security detail that they had planned on being on-duty was not present; they were, instead, approached by an unfamiliar face. Despite their uncertainty, [[Vex Calder|Vex]] decided to continue with their plan. He gave the man the file that contained the bribe--which would have worked if the other guard had been there to greet them.

They waited for several long, uncomfortable moments before they noticed the two overweight security guards armed with batons sharing grim looks, turning their eyes on the pair, and jogging towards them, unclipping their batons.

Movement on the floor above revealed officers (similar to police officers) from [[The Security Guild]] bursting into motion.

[[Vex Calder|Vex]] ordered [[Orbital Maintenance Bot 802 (Boz)|Boz]], who was still carrying the crate, to turn and run back to [[Scrap Dancer]]. They did so and the chase scene began!

(We used the Chase rules as found in *Savage Worlds* and found it very interesting! It's this idea of a rotating track that abstracts out some of the hard details of movement for a more cinematic mechanic!)

The officers quickly outpaced the overweight security guards but they were still too slow to get within range of [[Orbital Maintenance Bot 802 (Boz)|Boz]] and [[Vex Calder|Vex]] to use their stun guns. The pair managed to start the [[Scrap Dancer]]'s engines and they took off for safety, their fixer's package still undelivered and in their possession.
