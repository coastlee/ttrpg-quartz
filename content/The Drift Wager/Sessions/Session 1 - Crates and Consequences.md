# Session 1 - Crates and Consequences

The camera opens on your two characters amid the clang and hiss of a cramped cargo bay on [[Ordo V]]. They’ve just finished unloading a shipment of “custom machine parts” for a local fixer named [[Kethron Vask]]—only to discover that the payment code they've been given has already been flagged by the Security Guild.

As sirens begin to pulse faintly in the distance, Vask's representative nervously backs away, muttering something about "wrong registry tags" and "not my problem." Dockhands begin disappearing. Over comms, static bursts through with a voice: “We need that cargo returned. You’re not cleared to carry it—return it or face impoundment.”

Meanwhile, [[Zira Vonn|Zira]]'s sensors detect an encrypted beacon coming from one of the crates. Someone else might want what's inside.

## **Backstory: Vex & Zira vs. Kethron Vask**

- **Initial Job:** [[Kethron Vask|Kethron]] needed a discreet crew to move a crate of "custom machine parts" from a half-dead orbital depot to a drop point on [[Ordo V]].
- **[[Vex Calder|Vex]]**, always hungry for creds, didn’t ask too many questions—especially since [[Kethron Vask|Kethron]] offered 1.5x the going rate.
- **[[Zira Vonn|Zira]]** flagged inconsistencies in the crate’s manifest and noted it was heavily shielded for something labeled “non-hazardous.” She raised concerns—but curiosity got the better of her, and she let it go.
- **Kethron’s rep** met them with a payment chip that triggered a **[[The Security Guild|Security Guild]] sweep within hours**. [[Vex Calder|Vex]] and [[Zira Vonn|Zira]] escaped, but not clean.
- They suspect:
    - Either **[[Kethron Vask|Kethron]] knew it was dirty** and used them as decoys, or
    - Someone inside [[The Security Guild|the Guild]] or [[Trade Consortium]] is watching him, and they got caught in the blowback.   
- Since then, they haven’t confronted [[Kethron Vask|Kethron]]—but they haven’t written him off either. He still owes them **payment** and maybe **answers**.
