Aces are pilots and drivers who have a special affinity with their car, boat, plane, or other vehicle. They ignore two points of penalties to any Boating, Driving, or Piloting roll, and may spend Bennies to Soak damage for any vehicle they control or command, using the appropriate Boating, Driving, or Piloting skill instead of Vigor. Each success and raise negates a Wound.
