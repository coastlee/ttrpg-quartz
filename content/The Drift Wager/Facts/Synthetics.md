**Synthetics** are humanoid artificial intelligences housed in durable bio-metallic bodies. Originally designed for high-risk labor, orbital repair, or hazardous environments, synthetics vary in cognitive scopeâ€”from task-oriented drones to self-aware intelligences like [[Orbital Maintenance Bot 802 (Boz)|Zira]]. Corporate patents govern most models, though "liberated" synthetics are an emerging underground phenomenon.
