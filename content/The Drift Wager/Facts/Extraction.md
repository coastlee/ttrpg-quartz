When a character withdraws from melee, adjacent attackers get a free Fighting attack against him (see Withdrawing from Melee on page 109). This is a very dangerous proposition for most, but not your wily champion. When moving away from adjacent foes, one of them (player’s choice), doesn’t get his free Fighting attack.
