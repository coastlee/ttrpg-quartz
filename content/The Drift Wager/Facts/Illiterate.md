Your hero cannot read. He can sign his name and knows what a STOP sign says, but little else. He also doesn’t know much about math. He can probably do `2 + 2 = 4`, but multiplication and the like are beyond him. Illiterate characters can’t read or write in any language, by the way, no matter how many they actually speak.
