**Up.** [[The Drift Wager/Maps/NPCs|NPCs]]

A local fixer on [[Ordo V]].

**Kethron Vask** is a lean, sharp-featured man in his late 40s, with a clipped gray beard and ever-watchful eyes behind polarized ocular implants. His clothing walks the line between refinery and function: a tailored synth-leather jacket with stitched paneling, a slate-gray data gauntlet, and polished boots dusted with red ash from [[Ordo V]]’s rust storms. He speaks low, fast, and never wastes words—always ten seconds ahead in the conversation.

Locals say he used to be a logistics coordinator for a planetary union convoy—others say he ran message routes during the Thermite Uprising. Either way, he knows every dock code, bribery bracket, and customs blind spot in the region.

The protagonists know this:

- He’s reliable—but his favors always have hooks.
- He’s respected on Ordo V, especially in the mid-habs and port corridors. Even local security treads carefully around his business.
- He pays in credit sticks, high-grade fuel chips, or information. Never raw currency.
- His request for “custom machine parts” was vague—but the container was routed through a high-clearance port. Something in it isn’t meant to be inventoried.
