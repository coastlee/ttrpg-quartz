**Up.** [[Through Fire and Fractals]]

**[Character Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j-FDcyWxzFO1Fl6SMIeKvg8qcPawxtl8dTuf47RHbPQ/edit?usp=sharing).**

Part of [[The Skyfire Initiative]] experiment and dubbed **Subject 42-B**, Torrell was "recruited" as an infant when his family’s transport ship was intercepted near the volcanic world [[Kragos-7]]. Official records list him as deceased due to an "accident," but in reality, he was abducted by [[Skyfire Initiative|Skyfire operatives]].

Torell was part of **Cohort Delta**, a group of 10 subjects, all taken as children and raised in isolation. Each member of the cohort underwent different enhancement paths, but only three survived to adolescence, earning the label **"The Iron Three."** Torell was the sole pilot specialist among them.

The Skyfire Initiative was funded by [[The Helion Directive]], a shadowy division of the intergalactic conglomerate [[Apex Systems Corporation]], known for pushing the limits of bioengineering and weapons development. The Initiative was officially disbanded after a catastrophic incident involving another cohort, but remnants of the project continue in secret.

## Cohort Delta & The Iron Three

#### 1. **Kessara Rynn ("Blades")**

- **Role:** Close-quarters combat and infiltration specialist.
- **Enhancements:**
    - Reflexive neural enhancements allow near-instantaneous reactions to threats.
    - Biopolymer-enhanced musculature for silent, lethal strikes.
    - Adaptive dermal camouflage for blending into volcanic terrain and urban environments.
- **Personality:**  
    Calculating and fiercely independent, Kessara believes survival is earned, not given. She often clashed with Torell over his protective instincts but trusted him implicitly in dangerous missions.
- **Status:** After the collapse of the lab, Kessara disappeared, rumored to be working as a rogue operative for hire.

#### 2. **Derek "Forge" Maalyn**

- **Role:** Heavy support and demolitions expert.
- **Enhancements:**
    - Hardened skeletal structure resistant to extreme heat and impact.
    - Enhanced lung capacity for surviving in low-oxygen volcanic environments.
    - Thermal vision adapted for scouting in darkness or dense atmospheric conditions.
- **Personality:**  
    Jovial yet fiercely loyal, Derek acted as the emotional anchor of the group. Despite his intimidating physique and explosive expertise, he was the most empathetic and protective of the trio.
- **Status:** Derek was critically injured during their escape but sacrificed himself to ensure Torell and Kessara could flee.

### Dynamics of The Iron Three

The Iron Three were forged in the crucible of the Skyfire Initiative, developing a bond as deep as siblings but layered with tension born of their harsh upbringing. Each played a distinct role in the group, creating a dynamic of interdependence despite their contrasting personalities.

#### **Torell Tharock ("Ghost")**

- **Role:** Pilot and scout, the strategist of the group.
- **Dynamic:** Torell was the planner and risk-assessor. His pragmatic mindset often placed him at odds with Kessara's reckless tendencies. As the group's de facto leader, he bore the weight of their survival, occasionally isolating himself emotionally to protect the others.
- **Relationship with Kessara:** A mixture of respect and frustration. Torell admired her resilience but was often exasperated by her impulsive nature. Their heated arguments were frequent but never personal.
- **Relationship with Derek:** Torell saw Derek as the heart of the group. He relied on Derek's optimism and strength to counterbalance his own serious demeanor.

#### **Kessara Rynn ("Blades")**

- **Role:** The vanguard, often sent into danger first to scout or eliminate threats.
- **Dynamic:** Kessara's lone-wolf attitude sometimes clashed with Torell's team-oriented strategies. However, she trusted his leadership when it mattered most. She viewed Derek as her protector but was quick to tease him for being "soft."
- **Relationship with Torell:** A tense yet productive partnership. Kessara pushed Torell to take risks, and he reined her in when she got too bold. Beneath the tension, they shared an unspoken loyalty.
- **Relationship with Derek:** Kessara saw Derek as her opposite—strong and kind where she was sharp and cold. Despite this, she felt a deep, sibling-like bond with him, often covering for him in combat.

#### **Derek Maalyn ("Forge")**

- **Role:** Heavy support, morale booster, and occasional mediator.
- **Dynamic:** Derek served as the group's emotional core. His jokes and optimism kept the trio grounded, even in their darkest moments. He often played peacemaker between Torell and Kessara.
- **Relationship with Torell:** Derek respected Torell's strategic mind and often followed his lead without question. He occasionally encouraged Torell to open up emotionally, with mixed success.
- **Relationship with Kessara:** Derek adored Kessara like a younger sister, despite her biting sarcasm. He often covered for her during heated moments with Torell, acting as a buffer.
