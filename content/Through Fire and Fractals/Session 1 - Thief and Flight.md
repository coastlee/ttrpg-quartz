[[Torrell Tharock]] was running from [[Dane Jay]] and his crew of mercenaries or they might even be a military group. Torrell was running through an auction. He spotted something shiny to make a scene and scooped it up to cause chaos and commotion to slow down and confuse Dane's group.

[[Ten Jay]] spotted [[Torrell Tharock]] stealing the item and had an inkling of an idea of what that item ([[The Lens of Teyxar]]) did! So he decided to join [[Torrell Tharock]] in his flight.

They were running down a corridor where the crowds had thinned and posted guards began to shoot at them.
