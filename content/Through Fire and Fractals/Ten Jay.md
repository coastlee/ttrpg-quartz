**Name:** Ten Jay

**Age:** 25

**Role:** Former Space Navy Officer, Intelligence Operative, and Sniper

**Current Status:** Freelance mercenary navigating the galaxy’s moral gray zones

## Early Life

Ten Jay was born on [[Veyra Prime]], a sprawling industrial asteroid world rife with inequality and struggle. The youngest of four siblings, Ten grew up idolizing his older brother, [[Dane Jay]], a rising star in the [[Orion Star Navy (OSN)|OSN]]. Life on [[Veyra Prime]] was unforgiving, and Ten’s childhood was marked by grit and survival, sharpening his instincts and resilience.

Determined to escape the drudgery of his homeworld and follow in [[Dane Jay|Dane’s]] footsteps, Ten enlisted in the [[Orion Star Navy (OSN)|OSN]] at the age of 16, fabricating records to meet the minimum age requirement.

## Space Navy Years

Ten excelled in his early years aboard the [[Orion Star Navy (OSN)#Flagship Vessel|S.S. Resolute]], a frigate tasked with patrolling volatile trade routes on the outer rim. Under the mentorship of [[Commander Salia Kern]], a seasoned leader known for her balanced discipline and compassion, Ten quickly advanced.

### Key Event

During a surprise pirate ambush, Ten devised a daring counterattack that not only saved the **Resolute** but also cemented his reputation as a resourceful tactician. This incident caught the eye of Naval Intelligence, setting his next chapter in motion.

## Transition to Intelligence

At 20, Ten was recruited into the [[Naval Intelligence Directorate (NID)]]. There, he worked under [[Operative Cassian Drenn]], a master manipulator who taught Ten the nuances of deep-cover missions, espionage, and the murky moralities of intelligence work.

Ten’s assignments often involved infiltrating rival factions and collecting critical intelligence. His most dangerous mission was an undercover operation within the [[Alveon Syndicate]], a notorious criminal cartel with shadowy ties to rogue planetary governments.

### Key Event

During his time with the [[Alveon Syndicate|Syndicate]], Ten formed an uneasy alliance with [[Mila Rezra]], a talented hacker trapped in the organization. When his cover was compromised, [[Mila Rezra|Mila]] helped him escape, solidifying their bond and earning his loyalty.

## Becoming a Sniper

After three years in intelligence, Ten transitioned to a specialized sniper unit in the Navy. Drawn by the precision and independence the role offered, he trained under [[Sergeant Kira Vos]], a grizzled veteran who taught him not only marksmanship but also how to master the mental discipline required for long-distance, high-stakes missions.

### Key Skill

Ten became known for his expertise in “cold-zero” shots—single-bullet, high-risk eliminations performed under extreme conditions.

### Key Event

On a pivotal mission to eliminate a rogue naval officer suspected of selling secrets, Ten discovered the target was his former handler, [[Operative Cassian Drenn|Cassian Drenn]]. Unable to reconcile his loyalty with his growing disillusionment, Ten made the choice to spare [[Operative Cassian Drenn|Drenn’s]] life, falsifying the mission report to protect his former mentor.

## Current Standing

Disillusioned with the Navy’s politics and the moral compromises of intelligence work, Ten left the military at 23 to become a mercenary. Now, he roams the galaxy as a lone operative, offering his sniper and tactical expertise to the highest bidder while pursuing his personal vendetta against the [[Alveon Syndicate]] for [[Mila Rezra|Mila’s]] sake.

Though he works independently, Ten often crosses paths with both old allies and enemies. His actions walk the line between survival and justice, leaving others uncertain of where his loyalties truly lie.
