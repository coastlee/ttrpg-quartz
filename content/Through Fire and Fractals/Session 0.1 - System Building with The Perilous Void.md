## Scene 0.1: System Building with the Perilous Void

We made it through to step 7 on page 23. 

## Campaign Frame

The Campaign Frame's main focus is the **Age of Piracy**, with additional contextual threads such as the *Galactic Conflict* between [[United Stellar Federation (USF)]] and [[The Concordant Axis]]. We're likely to make *First Contact* with some aliens at some point; an *Anomaly Swarm* and *Gold Rush* scenarios are likely in our future.

## Jump Tech

We rolled on the table and got **Jumpgate Network**.

- Interstellar travel is made possible by way of a series of artificial jump points or gates that connect distant star systems.

## Interstellar Species

We decided to leverage the *What's O.L.D. is N.E.W.* species, namely [[Ogrons]], [[Borians]], [[Androids]], [[Vendalyrians]], [[Felans]], and [[Spartans]]. Humans, of course.

## Interstellar Societies and Relations

1. [[United Stellar Federation (USF)]] (Interplanetary Alliance)
2. [[The Non-Terrans' Union (NTU)]] (Alien Contingent)
3. [[Crimson Contract]] (Mercenary Coalition)
4. [[The Concordant Axis]] (Interplanetary Alliance)
5. [[Apex Systems Corporation]] and [[The Helion Directive]] (Corporate Conglomerate, Research Consortium)
6. [[Alveon Syndicate]] (Interstellar Syndicate)

### Society Types

**Interplanetary Alliance.** A group of neighboring planets or star systems that unite for
mutual defense, trade, and resource sharing.

**Alien Contingent.** A group of one or more NONHUMAN SPECIES (page 20), cooperating toward mutually beneficial ends.

**Mercenary Coalition.** Bands of mercenaries, bounty hunters, and soldiers-for-hire,
organized in their navigation of allegiances based on profit.

**Corporate Conglomerate.** A business alliance that controls resources, trade, and tech.

**Research Consortium.** A group of scientific organizations and think tanks that push
the boundaries of knowledge, often with their own agendas and ethical dilemmas.

**Interstellar Syndicate.** A criminal organization of smuggling rings that controls the
black market, illicit trade, and other shadowy operations.
