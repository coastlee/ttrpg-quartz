## Scene 0.1: System Building with the Perilous Void

We made it through to step 7 on page 23. 

## Campaign Frame

The Campaign Frame's main focus is the **Age of Piracy**, with additional contextual threads such as the *Galactic Conflict* between [[United Stellar Federation (USF)]] and [[The Concordant Axis]]. We're likely to make *First Contact* with some aliens at some point; an *Anomaly Swarm* and *Gold Rush* scenarios are likely in our future.

## Jump Tech

We rolled on the table and got **Jumpgate Network**.

- Interstellar travel is made possible by way of a series of artificial jump points or gates that connect distant star systems.

## Interstellar Species

We decided to leverage the *What's O.L.D. is N.E.W.* species, namely [[Ogrons]], [[Borians]], [[Androids]], [[Vendalyrians]], [[Felans]], and [[Spartans]]. Humans, of course.

mutual defense, trade, and resource sharing.
