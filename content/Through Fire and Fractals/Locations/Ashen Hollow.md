**Up.** [[Kragos-7]]

## Ashen Hollow

Ashen Hollow is a ramshackle settlement perched precariously on the edge of an ancient, dormant lava flow. Originally established by miners seeking to exploit nearby volcanic mineral veins, it has since degenerated into a haven for traders, scavengers, and outlaws. The settlement’s structures are a haphazard collection of metal shanties, reinforced with scavenged parts and cooled volcanic stone. The air is thick with ash, and the dim glow of nearby magma vents casts an eerie light over the settlement at night.

**Key Features:**

- **The Smoldering Ember Auction Hall:**  
    The main draw of Ashen Hollow, this crude, reinforced dome hosts frequent auctions for rare and illicit items. Its reputation attracts smugglers, rogue scientists, and adventurers looking to acquire unique technology, artifacts, or experimental goods. Security is lax, relying on mercenaries and outdated defense systems.
    
- **The Hollow Bazaar:**  
    A chaotic marketplace where merchants and vendors peddle salvaged tech, counterfeit goods, and exotic creatures brought from the Emberfield asteroid belt.
    
- **The Ashspire Cantina:**  
    A dilapidated bar and inn serving questionable food and drink. It’s a hub for rumors and a neutral ground for meeting contacts. The cantina has an old jukebox that plays crackly tunes, often drowned out by the hum of machinery.
    
- **Blaze Junction Landing Pad:**  
    The single, poorly maintained landing pad outside the settlement. The surrounding terrain makes landings treacherous, and the pad itself is often crowded with skiffs and cargo ships in various states of disrepair.

**Population:**  
Approximately 1,200, consisting mostly of miners, scavengers, and outlaws. The majority are humans, but a small contingent of Borians and Ogrons help run the more physical operations. Felans and Vendalyrians occasionally pass through as traders or smugglers.

**Notable NPCs:**

- **Mira Veck (Human):** The auctioneer running the Smoldering Ember Auction Hall. She’s sharp-tongued, calculating, and untrustworthy, willing to sell out buyers to the highest bidder.
    
- **Brakk "Ironjaw" Varlin (Ogron):** A former miner turned enforcer who ensures no one disrupts the auctions—unless they pay him off first.
    
- **Irris Klenn (Borrian):** A tech merchant operating in the Bazaar who specializes in repairing scavenged or stolen equipment.

**Proximity to Prominent Cities:**  
The closest prominent city to Ashen Hollow is [[**Obsidian Reach**]], located about 350 kilometers away. This distance makes Ashen Hollow an ideal stopover for smugglers and rogue traders operating in the area, as it’s far enough from Obsidian Reach’s crime syndicates to avoid constant oversight but close enough for trade routes.
