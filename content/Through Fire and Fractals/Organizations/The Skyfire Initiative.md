The Skyfire Initiative was funded by [[The Helion Directive]], a shadowy division of the intergalactic conglomerate [[Apex Systems Corporation]], known for pushing the limits of bioengineering and weapons development. The Initiative was officially disbanded after a catastrophic incident involving another cohort, but remnants of the project continue in secret.

The "Skyfire Initiative" was a covert project aimed at engineering biologically enhanced individuals to thrive in extreme environments, excel in piloting high-performance spacecraft, and act as elite reconnaissance operatives.
