## Scene 1: Flight to Obsidian Reach

**Chaos Factor.** 4

**Set the Scene.** We are traveling in [[Astra Veyl]]'s ship away from [[Ashen Hollow]] towards [[Obsidian Reach]]. We expect that our flight in her ship goes well.

Questions to ask:

1. Can [[Astra Veyl]] track her ship?
	1. 93 on Very Likely, CF 4 the answer is **NO**
2. Does the setting have FTL communication technology?
	1. Not asking this to mythic, just going to state that since we have FTL travel, we have FTL communication
3. Does she report to anyone that she knows in [[Obsidian Reach]]?
	1. 25 on Very Likely, CF 4 the answer is **YES**

Testing the Scene: 5 on CF 4 -- Expected Scene. We arrive without issue at Obsidian Reach.

Our characters chatted about [[Torrell Tharock]]'s past and he basically summarized that he was a specialist operative on a job with his group. Group was scattered and the enemies of his job contact are now chasing Torrell and Torrell's trying to get away.

[[Torrell Tharock]] asked [[Ten Jay]] why he followed him and helped him fight off those goons?

*Ten is disillusioned with the government and politics so he's operating on his own, offering his skills to the highest bidder. Vendeta against the Alvion Syndicate (for whom he was an undercover operative.).*

*Now we're trying to figure out what Ten would say. Does he admit to his obsession with the Lens? Or is he quick on his feet and spouts some lie?*

I need to look into building a ChatGPT room with multiple people!
