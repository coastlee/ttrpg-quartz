**Up.** [[Sessions]]
## Scene 1: Flight to Obsidian Reach

**Chaos Factor.** 4

**Set the Scene.** We are traveling in [[Astra Veyl]]'s ship away from [[Ashen Hollow]] towards [[Obsidian Reach]]. We expect that our flight in her ship goes well.

Questions to ask:

1. Can [[Astra Veyl]] track her ship?
	1. 93 on Very Likely, CF 4 the answer is **NO**
2. Does the setting have FTL communication technology?
	1. Not asking this to mythic, just going to state that since we have FTL travel, we have FTL communication
3. Does she report to anyone that she knows in [[Obsidian Reach]]?
	1. 25 on Very Likely, CF 4 the answer is **YES**

Testing the Scene: 5 on CF 4 -- Expected Scene. We arrive without issue at Obsidian Reach.

Our characters chatted about [[Torrell Tharock]]'s past and he basically summarized that he was a specialist operative on a job with his group. Group was scattered and the enemies of his job contact are now chasing Torrell and Torrell's trying to get away.

[[Torrell Tharock]] asked [[Ten Jay]] why he followed him and helped him fight off those goons?

*Ten is disillusioned with the government and politics so he's operating on his own, offering his skills to the highest bidder. Vendeta against the Alvion Syndicate (for whom he was an undercover operative.).*

*Now we're trying to figure out what Ten would say. Does he admit to his obsession with the Lens? Or is he quick on his feet and spouts some lie?*

I need to look into building a ChatGPT room with multiple people!

## Why did Ten join Torrell?

**Ten Jay pauses at the edge of the dimly lit ship corridor, the hum of the stolen vessel’s drive core pulsing in the background. He turns to face Torrell, eyes steady, rifle slung across his back.

**"You’re not the first to chase the Lens, Torrell. But you might be the first one to actually hold it and still be breathing."**

He steps a little closer, calm but intense.

**"I’ve been tracking that artifact for years—intel briefings, half-burned scrolls, encrypted data caches. The Navy classified it as a myth. Intelligence called it a distraction. I didn’t agree with either."**

He lets that settle, then gives a small, almost amused shrug.

**"Then I see you swipe it in front of half the Syndicate and three corp delegates. And not only that—you survive. So I had a choice: either take you down… or find out if you’re smart enough to use it."**

He leans against the bulkhead, arms crossed now.

**"You’re holding the key to something that could change how we move through the stars. That kind of tech doesn’t belong in a vault or behind a Syndicate laser grid. It belongs with someone who understands what it means—and what it can do."**

**"I followed you because I’ve been chasing the Lens longer than you’ve been running from it. And because… maybe we both want the same thing."**

**Torrell stands in the cockpit doorway, silhouetted by the flicker of sublight stars. His expression is unreadable—calculating, like he’s assembling a puzzle he doesn’t yet know all the pieces to.**

**“So that’s it,”** he says after a long pause. **“You followed me because you think I know what to do with this thing?”**

He holds up the Lens of Teyxar between two gloved fingers, examining it like it’s a puzzle box.

**“News flash: I don’t. Didn’t even know what it was until everyone started screaming for my head.”**  
**“I stole it to create a distraction. Turns out I stole the galaxy’s most wanted paperweight.”**

His eyes narrow slightly as he studies Ten Jay, not with suspicion exactly, but with the cold-eyed habit of someone trained to assess threats—and assets.

**“You… you didn’t flinch when the Syndicate turned on me. You had options, clean exits. But you stuck around.”**

He tucks the Lens back into a sealed compartment, his voice shifting from wary to strategic.

**“Alright. You’ve got history with the Lens. I’ve got it in my hand and a death squad on my back. So here’s the play: you help me figure out what this thing really is and how we use it before someone melts us for it.”**

He steps closer now, the tension easing just a little.

**“But I’m not looking for a fanboy or a bodyguard. I want a partner who knows how to stay alive, who won’t freeze when things go sideways. You think you can be that?”**

Beat.

**“Because if not, there’s still time to toss you out the airlock before we hit driftspace.”**

## Decision Where to Land

Night time.

**[[Zephrax-9]]** - [[Ten Jay]] has a contact lined up here. We rolled on the meaning tables and got *coolly festive* and we decided had something to do with a festival that hinted at some more of the myths and legends behind the [[The Lens of Teyxar]]. So Ten shares that this job has something to do with the Lens.

We talked about selling the ship for parts to create a mystery surrounding our escape. Where did the ship? No ones knows in an ideal world.

MYTHIC QUESTION: Do we know any grungy salvage or ship yards in the area?
- CF 4 on Likely: 21 (YES)

Land in [[Varnis "Scrapjaw" Dex]]'s scrapyard. We let him know that it's Ten, he comms back and asks what we want and tells us where to park. Why are you here in the middle of the night?

We tell him that we've the got skiff to sale for pennies on the dollar. Ten reminds him of a favor he owes. The only caveat is that he wants nothing to do with where we came from, so he has to act quick to get it dissembled for parts. We rolled a 2d6 persuade by Ten, marked the TN down to 4 (from 7), and got a result of 7. Varnis agrees to help us out.

We're assuming he can get $50,000 and we're asking him to pay $5,000. Going for $10k, going to a charisma roll. TN 8 on 2d6.

Barter Roll (2d6): 8

Transaction happens, he wires us the funds ($5k each).

> MYTHIC QUESTION: Does anyone see, spot, or otherwise detect the presence of [[Astra Veyl]]'s ship approaching [[Obsidian Reach]]? (CF 4, Unlikely)
- 48 - No


## Scene 2: Find Passage to [[Zephrax-9]]
