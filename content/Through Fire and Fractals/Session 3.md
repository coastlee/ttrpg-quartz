**Up.** [[Sessions]]

# 📘 Scene 1: Flight to [[Obsidian Reach]]

**Chaos Factor:** 4  
**Setting:** Aboard [[Astra Veyl]]’s ship, en route from [[Ashen Hollow]] to [[Obsidian Reach]].

---

## ✨ Summary

[[Torrell Tharock]] and [[Ten Jay]] flee [[Ashen Hollow]] aboard a stolen ship once belonging to [[Astra Veyl]]. Their destination is the [[Obsidian Reach]], where [[Ten Jay|Ten]] has a contact at a salvage yard. The flight is uneventful, but the characters share a critical exchange about trust, motivation, and the mysterious [[The Lens of Teyxar|Lens of Teyxar]].

Along the way, [[Ten Jay|Ten]] reveals his obsession with the [[The Lens of Teyxar|Lens]], and the two begin forming a fragile alliance. They plan to disappear by selling the ship for parts. Upon arrival, they contact [[Varnis "Scrapjaw" Dex]], who agrees—under the table—to help them disappear the ship.

Their negotiations succeed, and the characters earn some fast credits while keeping their presence low-profile.

## 🛠️ Dialogue: Trust and the Lens

> **Ten Jay** pauses at the edge of the dimly lit ship corridor, the hum of the drive core pulsing in the background. He turns to face Torrell, eyes steady.
> 
> “You’re not the first to chase the Lens, Torrell. But you might be the first one to actually hold it and still be breathing.”
> 
> He steps a little closer.
> 
> “I’ve been tracking that artifact for years—intel briefings, half-burned scrolls, encrypted data caches. The Navy called it a myth. Intelligence said it was a distraction. I didn’t agree.”
> 
> _He shrugs slightly._
> 
> “Then I see you swipe it in front of half the Syndicate and three corp delegates. And survive. I had a choice: take you down, or find out if you’re smart enough to use it.”
> 
> _He leans against the bulkhead, arms crossed._
> 
> “You’re holding the key to something that could change how we move through the stars. That kind of tech doesn’t belong in a vault. It belongs with someone who understands it.”
> 
> “I followed you because I’ve been chasing the Lens longer than you’ve been running from it. And maybe we both want the same thing.”

> **Torrell** stands in the cockpit doorway, silhouetted by the flicker of sublight stars. His expression is unreadable.
> 
> “So that’s it? You followed me because you think I know what to do with this thing?”
> 
> _He holds up the Lens of Teyxar between two fingers._
> 
> “News flash: I don’t. Didn’t even know what it was until everyone started screaming for my head.”
> 
> “I stole it to create a distraction. Turns out I stole the galaxy’s most wanted paperweight.”
> 
> _He narrows his eyes at Ten Jay._
> 
> “You didn’t flinch when the Syndicate turned on me. You had exits. But you stuck around.”
> 
> _He tucks the Lens away and softens slightly._
> 
> “Alright. You’ve got history with the Lens. I’ve got it in my hand and a death squad on my back. So here’s the play: you help me figure out what this thing is before someone melts us.”
> 
> “But I’m not looking for a fanboy or a bodyguard. I want a partner who knows how to stay alive. You think you can be that?”
> 
> _Beat._
> 
> “Because if not, there’s still time to toss you out the airlock before we hit driftspace.”

 [Ten Jay](Ten Jay) has a contact lined up here. We rolled on the meaning tables and got _coolly festive_ and we decided had something to do with a festival that hinted at some more of the myths and legends behind the [The Lens of Teyxar](https://quartz.antionite.cc/Through-Fire-and-Fractals/Items/The-Lens-of-Teyxar). So Ten shares that this job has something to do with the Lens.

## 🧰 [[Varnis “Scrapjaw” Dex]]

**Contact:** [[Ten Jay]] calls on [[Varnis "Scrapjaw" Dex|Varnis]], a salvage yard operator who owes him a favor.

> Varnis responds, skeptical: “Middle of the night, Ten? What the hell do you want?”
> 
> Ten: “We’ve got a skiff to sell for pennies on the dollar. Need it vanished, fast. Remember that favor you owed me?”
> 
> Varnis: “$10,000 creds? Deal. I should be able to get $50,000 out of that. It'll be scrapped by sunrise.”
