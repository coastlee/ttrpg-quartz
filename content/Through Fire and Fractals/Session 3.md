## Scene 1: Flight to Obsidian Reach

**Chaos Factor.** 4

**Set the Scene.** We are traveling in [[Astra Veyl]]'s ship away from [[Ashen Hollow]] towards [[Obsidian Reach]]. We expect that our flight in her ship goes well.

Questions to ask:

1. Can [[Astra Veyl]] track her ship?
	1. 93 on Very Likely, CF 4 the answer is **NO**
2. Does the setting have FTL communication technology?
	1. Not asking this to mythic, just going to state that since we have FTL travel, we have FTL communication
3. Does she report to anyone that she knows in [[Obsidian Reach]]?
	1. 25 on Very Likely, CF 4 the answer is **YES**

Testing the Scene: 5 on CF 4 -- Expected Scene. We arrive without issue at Obsidian Reach.

Our characters chatted about [[Torrell Tharock]]'s past and he basically summarized that he was a specialist operative on a job with his group. Group was scattered and the enemies of his job contact are now chasing Torrell and Torrell's trying to get away.

[[Torrell Tharock]] asked [[Ten Jay]] why he followed him and helped him fight off those goons?

*Ten is disillusioned with the government and politics so he's operating on his own, offering his skills to the highest bidder. Vendeta against the Alvion Syndicate (for whom he was an undercover operative.).*

*Now we're trying to figure out what Ten would say. Does he admit to his obsession with the Lens? Or is he quick on his feet and spouts some lie?*

I need to look into building a ChatGPT room with multiple people!

## Why did Ten join Torrell?

**Ten Jay pauses at the edge of the dimly lit ship corridor, the hum of the stolen vessel’s drive core pulsing in the background. He turns to face Torrell, eyes steady, rifle slung across his back.

**"You’re not the first to chase the Lens, Torrell. But you might be the first one to actually hold it and still be breathing."**

He steps a little closer, calm but intense.

**"I’ve been tracking that artifact for years—intel briefings, half-burned scrolls, encrypted data caches. The Navy classified it as a myth. Intelligence called it a distraction. I didn’t agree with either."**

He lets that settle, then gives a small, almost amused shrug.

**"Then I see you swipe it in front of half the Syndicate and three corp delegates. And not only that—you survive. So I had a choice: either take you down… or find out if you’re smart enough to use it."**

He leans against the bulkhead, arms crossed now.

**"You’re holding the key to something that could change how we move through the stars. That kind of tech doesn’t belong in a vault or behind a Syndicate laser grid. It belongs with someone who understands what it means—and what it can do."**

**"I followed you because I’ve been chasing the Lens longer than you’ve been running from it. And because… maybe we both want the same thing."**
