## Scene 0.2: Sector Creation

### Interstellar Societies & Relations

We made it through steps 7 and 9.

We decided to only determine how the [[USF]] currently interfaces with other interstellar societies.
Perhaps we will revisit this at some other point in time.

### Sector Creation

We generated the **Sector Chart** randomly (for the most part). We have a small variety of star types,
identified our **starting location as 0606**, identified two different nebulae (one that's a Giant Molecular Cloud),
and even have a *Nanite Swarm Anomaly*. One system has two stars, which is home to the pirates known as
[[The Crimson Contract]]. 

Finally, we identified homes for our 6 different Interstellar Societies.

### Total Progress
