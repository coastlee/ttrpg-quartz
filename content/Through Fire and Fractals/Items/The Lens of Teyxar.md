Ten, being a mercenary with little cash and a practical mindset, might latch onto exaggerated or fantastical elements of the Lens of Teyxar's legend. His belief in its abilities could be shaped by desperation, wishful thinking, or tall tales from disreputable sources in the cantinas and markets he frequents.

### What Ten Might Believe:

1. **"The Lens Generates Wealth Through Navigation to Untouched Resources"**  
    Ten could believe the Lens has the ability to locate hidden or untouched worlds rich in valuable resources, such as rare minerals, ancient technology, or uncharted trade routes. He might think the Lens could lead him directly to a fortune without the need for dangerous mercenary work.
    
2. **"It Can Be Used to Predict the Future of Starship Movements"**  
    Misinterpreting its tracking ability, Ten might believe the Lens can predict where ships will be before they arrive, making it invaluable for setting ambushes, avoiding conflicts, or preemptively seizing goods. This would be a game-changing tool for a mercenary trying to outmaneuver competitors or bounty hunters.
    
3. **"The Lens Unlocks Access to Ancient Vendalyrian Vaults"**  
    Tales might have reached Ten that the Lens can decipher lost Vendalyrian codes and grant access to their legendary treasure vaults. He could see it as a shortcut to riches and the fulfillment of countless scavenger dreams.
    
4. **"It's a Miracle Engine Upgrade"**  
    Ten might have heard that the Lens can drastically improve a starship's engine efficiency or speed, reducing fuel costs and making rapid interstellar travel accessible to someone of limited means. He could see it as a ticket to becoming a successful and independent freelancer.
    
5. **"It Can Render Its Holder Invisible to All Scans and Sensors"**  
    A variation of its masking ability might have been exaggerated into the belief that the Lens makes its wielder entirely undetectableâ€”an irresistible lure for someone with enemies or debts to escape from.
