Former hacker for the [[Alveon Syndicate]] who helped [[Ten Jay|Ten]] escape. She is now a close ally, providing intel and tech support for his mercenary work.

**Name:** Mila Rezra
**Role:** Former Alveon Syndicate Hacker, Tech Specialist, and Ally
**Age:** 24
**Personality:** Resourceful, Witty, Cautiously Optimistic 

## Current Status

Independent operative assisting [[Ten Jay]] while pursuing her own vendetta against the [[Alveon Syndicate|Syndicate]].

## Background

Mila Rezra grew up on [[Tritan Station]], a freeport known for its thriving black markets and patchwork communities of exiles, mercenaries, and opportunists. 

The child of a mechanic and a data analyst, Mila was surrounded by technology from an early age. By 10, she was hacking simple systems, and by her teens, she had become a prodigy in cybersecurity and system infiltration. 

Mila’s talents caught the attention of the [[Alveon Syndicate]], a powerful criminal cartel specializing in smuggling, cybercrime, and weapons trafficking. Promised protection and resources, Mila was coerced into working for the [[Alveon Syndicate|Syndicate]], where her skills were exploited for years.

### Role in the [[Alveon Syndicate]]

Within the [[Alveon Syndicate|Syndicate]], Mila served as a high-level hacker, tasked with disabling security systems, stealing data, and developing counterintelligence measures. Despite her outward compliance, Mila secretly detested the [[Alveon Syndicate|Syndicate's]] ruthless practices, especially its exploitation of vulnerable populations.

### Key Traits of Her Time in the [[Alveon Syndicate|Syndicate]]

- **Survivor Mentality:** Mila learned how to navigate the [[Alveon Syndicate|Syndicate's]] dangerous hierarchy, staying under the radar while subtly sabotaging its operations.
- **Moral Compass:** Unlike many [[Alveon Syndicate|Syndicate]] members, Mila maintained a sense of ethics, helping innocent targets whenever possible.

### Connection to [[Ten Jay]]

Mila first crossed paths with [[Ten Jay]] during his deep-cover mission within the [[Alveon Syndicate|Syndicate]]. Initially wary of [[Ten Jay|Ten]], she eventually recognized his intentions and decided to trust him—a decision that would change the trajectory of her life.

#### Key Events with [[Ten Jay|Ten]]

##### Cover Blown

When [[Ten Jay|Ten’s]] cover was compromised, Mila used her hacking expertise to disable surveillance systems and forge an escape route. In doing so, she risked her own life, severing her ties to the [[Alveon Syndicate|Syndicate]] permanently.

This act of defiance marked the beginning of her alliance with [[Ten Jay|Ten]] and cemented her role as his confidante and ally.

##### Escape to [[The Outer Rim]]

After fleeing the [[Alveon Syndicate|Syndicate]], Mila and [[Ten Jay|Ten]] lay low on [[The Outer Rim]], where they began dismantling [[Alveon Syndicate|Syndicate]] operations one piece at a time. Mila provided crucial intelligence and technological support, while [[Ten Jay|Ten]] executed missions requiring his tactical and sniper expertise.

## Personality and Skills

Mila is a blend of technical brilliance and human warmth. Her wit and optimism help balance the darker aspects of their work, though she carries her own scars from years under the [[Alveon Syndicate|Syndicate's]] control.

### Key Skills

- **Hacking and Cybersecurity:** Mila excels in breaking into highly secured systems, developing counter-surveillance tools, and manipulating digital infrastructure.
- **Engineering Expertise:** She can modify and repair advanced technology, from weaponry to spacecraft systems.
- **Espionage Support:** Mila uses her technical skills to gather intelligence, disrupt enemy operations, and provide real-time support during missions.

### Current Motivations

#### Revenge Against the Syndicate

Mila is driven by a desire to dismantle the [[Alveon Syndicate]], not only for her own freedom but also to avenge the lives they’ve ruined. Her efforts align closely with [[Ten Jay|Ten’s]] vendetta against the same organization.

#### Finding Purpose

Mila is trying to reclaim her identity after years of being defined by the [[Alveon Syndicate|Syndicate]]. Her partnership with [[Ten Jay|Ten]] offers her a sense of agency and belonging, though she occasionally questions whether their quest for justice will lead to anything meaningful.
#### Protecting Those She Cares About

Mila feels a deep sense of responsibility toward [[Ten Jay|Ten]] and others caught in the [[Alveon Syndicate|Syndicate's]] web. Her loyalty to [[Ten Jay|Ten]] is unwavering, though she sometimes clashes with him over his more detached or pragmatic decisions.
