[[Ten Jay|Ten's]] charismatic and morally ambiguous handler; spared by Ten during a critical mission and now living under the radar. Their relationship remains complicated.

**Age:** 39 Personality: Charismatic, Calculating, Ruthless Current 
**Status:** On the run after being exposed as a rogue agent

## Background 

Cassian Drenn grew up on [[Tarsis IV]], a mid-tier colony world known for its trade hubs and political intrigue. Born into a family of diplomats, Cassian was groomed for negotiation and manipulation from an early age. However, his rebellious nature and disdain for bureaucracy pushed him toward a career in intelligence rather than politics. 

He joined the [[Naval Intelligence Directorate (NID)]] in his early twenties and quickly rose through the ranks due to his sharp mind and ability to think several steps ahead. Cassian gained a reputation for his uncanny ability to predict his opponents' moves and his willingness to bend the rules to achieve mission success.

Cassian gained a reputation for his uncanny ability to predict his opponents' moves and his willingness to bend the rules to achieve mission success.

### Role in Ten's Life

Cassian was assigned as Ten Jay’s handler when Ten first joined Naval Intelligence. While Cassian initially saw Ten as just another pawn in his schemes, he quickly recognized Ten’s resourcefulness and unorthodox thinking. Over time, Cassian became both a mentor and a manipulative guide, shaping Ten into an effective operative but also exposing him to the harsh moral ambiguities of intelligence work.

#### Key Traits of the Relationshiop

**Mentorship:** Cassian was instrumental in teaching [[Ten Jay|Ten]] the art of espionage, including deep-cover tactics, psychological manipulation, and strategic improvisation. He often framed intelligence work as a “game of shadows” where the only rule is survival.

**Morally Ambiguous Influence:** Cassian’s philosophy—that loyalty and morality are secondary to achieving results—left a lasting impression on [[Ten Jay|Ten]], though it also sparked inner conflict.

**Betrayal and Complexity:** While Cassian genuinely valued [[Ten Jay|Ten's]] skills, his own self-preservation always came first, leading to situations where Ten felt like a disposable asset.

#### Key Events with [[Ten Jay|Ten]]

##### Mission to Infiltrate the Alveon Syndicate

Cassian personally selected [[Ten Jay|Ten]] for a high-stakes undercover operation within the [[Alveon Syndicate]]. Cassian’s precise planning enabled [[Ten Jay|Ten]] to embed successfully, but he withheld critical intel about the risks, leaving [[Ten Jay|Ten]] in a precarious situation when his cover was blown.
When [[Ten Jay|Ten]] narrowly escaped with [[Mila Rezra]]’s help, he discovered that Cassian had knowingly put him at risk to test his loyalty and resilience.

##### The Rogue Agent Revelation

Cassian’s downfall began when evidence surfaced implicating him in selling classified **Naval Intelligence** data to rival factions. While some believed he had turned rogue out of greed, others suspected a deeper, more complex motive, such as exposing corruption within the Navy.

[[Ten Jay|Ten]] was assigned the mission to neutralize Cassian. During their final confrontation, Cassian revealed pieces of the Navy’s inner corruption, planting seeds of doubt in [[Ten Jay|Ten's]] mind. Rather than execute him, [[Ten Jay|Ten]] allowed Cassian to escape, a decision that would haunt him and further complicate his view of loyalty and duty.

### Possible Motivations

- **Exposing Corruption:** Cassian may be working to uncover and dismantle systemic corruption within the Navy, framing his actions as necessary sacrifices for the greater good.
- **Self-Preservation:** Alternatively, Cassian’s actions could simply reflect his survival instinct, exploiting the chaos he creates for personal gain.
- **A Mix of Both:** Cassian’s true motivations might lie somewhere in between, keeping his intentions murky and his loyalties unclear.

#### Impact on Ten Jay

Cassian remains a lingering presence in [[Ten Jay|Ten's]] life, both as a mentor who shaped his skills and a cautionary figure who embodies the dark path [[Ten Jay|Ten]] could take. Their complex relationship influences [[Ten Jay|Ten's]] decisions, especially as he grapples with the blurred lines between duty, survival, and morality.
## Cassian’s Current Status

Now a fugitive, Cassian lives in the shadows, constantly on the move to avoid both Navy operatives and the factions he once betrayed. He operates as a rogue agent, using his extensive knowledge of intelligence networks to stay ahead of his pursuers.
