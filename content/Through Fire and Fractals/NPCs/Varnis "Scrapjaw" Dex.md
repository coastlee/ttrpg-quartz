## 🔧 **Salvage Yard: "Scrapjaw's Roost"**

**Location:** Southern rim of [[Obsidian Reach]], perched above a cracked lava trench and surrounded by heaps of scrap hulls and broken mech parts. Old industrial cranes creak in the ash-laden wind. A faded sign with flickering neon reads: `S💀RAPJAW'S R🍂ST - NO QUESTIONS, CASH ONLY.`

## 🧑‍🔧 **Contact: Varnis "Scrapjaw" Dex**

- **Species:** Borian
    
- **Age:** Mid-50s in Borian years (physically and mentally quick despite his grungy exterior)
    
- **Appearance:** A stocky, dirt-smudged Borian with mechanical arms that hum softly when he moves. His right optical implant constantly glitches, and his back brace is made from a scavenged starship girder. Wears a leather apron reinforced with plating from a crashed dropship.
    
- **Demeanor:** Gruff, sarcastic, and deeply paranoid—but begrudgingly loyal to those who’ve earned his respect.

## 🛠️ **History with [[Ten Jay]]:**

Ten met Varnis years ago after crash-landing a stolen dropship on the edge of Obsidian Reach during a failed extraction job. Most mechanics would’ve turned him in—or gutted the ship for profit—but Varnis helped patch it together in exchange for Ten taking a very suspicious crate of “non-biological components” offworld.

Since then, they’ve had an unspoken agreement: Ten doesn’t ask about the cargo that crosses Varnis’ salvage yard, and Varnis doesn’t report any visitors. Varnis occasionally fed Ten low-risk odd jobs or helped strip merc tech for resale.

## 🧨 **Reaction to the Skiff Landing in the Middle of the Night:**

Varnis is awoken by motion sensors and immediately rolls out of bed, grabbing a rusty plasma welder and muttering curses. As the skiff descends, he watches from a cracked monitor in a control shack.

His reaction:

> “The void are you doing landing here with heat on your tail, Ten? I just got the yard to stop smoldering from that last Ogron fight. This better not be your usual flaming crash-&-beg routine... but if it is—_park it behind the crawler hulls. Fast._”

Though irritable, Varnis respects Ten and owes him a small favor—maybe for once not ratting him out to a border patrol looking for black market parts. Still, his tolerance has limits, and _he’ll expect compensation or a favor in return for silence and assistance._
