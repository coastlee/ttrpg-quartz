**Up.** [[NPCs]]

Subject survivor of [[The Skyfire Initiative]] and peer to [[Torrell Tharock]] and [[Derek "Forge" Maalyn]].
 
- **Role:** Close-quarters combat and infiltration specialist.
- **Enhancements:**
    - Reflexive neural enhancements allow near-instantaneous reactions to threats.
    - Biopolymer-enhanced musculature for silent, lethal strikes.
    - Adaptive dermal camouflage for blending into volcanic terrain and urban environments.
- **Personality:**  
    Calculating and fiercely independent, Kessara believes survival is earned, not given. She often clashed with Torell over his protective instincts but trusted him implicitly in dangerous missions.
- **Status:** After the collapse of the lab, Kessara disappeared, rumored to be working as a rogue operative for hire.
