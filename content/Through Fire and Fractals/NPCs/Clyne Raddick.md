### NPC Name: **Clyne Raddick**

- **Description:**  
    Clyne Raddick is a wiry man in his mid-30s, with sharp, angular features and piercing gray eyes that seem to miss nothing. His short-cropped black hair is streaked with premature silver, and he has a faint scar running from his left eyebrow to his temple, a souvenir from an earlier skirmish.
    
    Raddick wears a patched but well-maintained exo-suit equipped with a shoulder-mounted tactical scanner and a holster for his plasma repeater. Despite his lean frame, he carries himself with the confidence of someone who has survived countless firefights.
    
- **Personality:**  
    Pragmatic and cunning, Raddick thrives in chaotic situations by exploiting his opponent’s weaknesses. He has a sardonic sense of humor and enjoys taunting his enemies mid-battle. Known for his tactical acumen, he often focuses on strategies that disrupt and weaken defenses, perfectly aligning with the "Hinder Defense" action focus.
    
- **Motivation:**  
    Raddick is a freelancer recently hired by Dane Jay as a scout and secondary enforcer. He’s motivated by credits and the thrill of the hunt, but his loyalty only extends as far as the payday.

During the chaos of the firefight outside the auction:

- **Critical Error:** Clyne, trying to outmaneuver Torell and Ten, attempts to lob a smoke grenade for cover. However, he miscalculates the throw, and the grenade lands too close to his own position. The dense smoke obstructs his vision and forces him and his ally to retreat further from their cover.
    
- **Impact on Defense:**
    
    - Torell and Ten seize the opportunity to reposition into superior cover, gaining a tactical advantage.
    - Clyne’s blunder creates confusion for his team, temporarily weakening their defensive posture and leaving them vulnerable to counterattacks.

### Negative Outcome for Dane’s Defense: "Friendly Fire Mishap"

Alternatively, if Clyne is one of Dane’s men, his error directly impacts Dane’s forces:

- **Critical Error:** Under pressure from Torell and Ten’s suppressive fire, Clyne accidentally sets off an automated turret defense tied to the auction’s perimeter security system. The turret targets Dane’s men, mistaking them for hostiles.
    
- **Impact on Dane’s Team:**
    
    - The turret’s fire divides Dane’s forces, forcing them to split their attention between the turret and Torell’s team.
    - This error creates a temporary vulnerability in Dane’s coordinated assault, potentially giving Torell and Ten an opening to escape.
