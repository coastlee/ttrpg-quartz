### Why Is the Skiff There?

The skiff belongs to a **smuggler** named **Astra Veyl**, a cunning Felan (feline-like humanoid) with a reputation for discreetly transporting rare goods between volcanic worlds and more stable systems. She’s been attending the auction to secure illicit tech that wasn’t officially on the auction block, using her ship as a quick getaway vehicle.

### Who Is Astra Veyl, and Where Is She?

- **Appearance:** Astra has sleek, jet-black fur with silvery streaks running down her arms and tail. Her glowing yellow eyes are striking, and her sharp, retractable claws hint at her dual nature: graceful yet deadly. She dresses in layered fabrics and leather reinforced with light armor, blending practicality and style.
    
- **Personality:** Charismatic but cautious, Astra avoids direct conflict when possible, relying on wit and negotiation to get what she wants. However, if cornered, she’s a fierce fighter and a crack pilot.
    
- **Current Whereabouts:** Astra is still inside the auction hall, arguing with a vendor over the authenticity of a rare data crystal. She left her skiff on standby at the landing pad, confident in the ship’s security protocols but unaware of the firefight erupting outside.

### How Does This Play Out?

1. **Torell and Ten’s Quick Thinking:**  
    The pair reach the skiff and, despite the locking mechanism, Torell uses his piloting expertise and familiarity with older models to hotwire it. Ten watches the perimeter, ensuring they aren’t ambushed mid-theft.
    
2. **Complications:**  
    The skiff is equipped with a remote alarm system that alerts Astra to unauthorized access. As Torell powers up the skiff, Astra receives a notification on her wrist device and immediately abandons her argument, rushing toward the landing pad.
    
3. **Future Entanglement:**
    
    - If Torell and Ten successfully escape, Astra could become a recurring character seeking revenge for the theft—or perhaps leverage her lost ship as a reason to pursue them, ultimately forming a reluctant alliance.
    - Alternatively, if they’re delayed by Astra's intervention, it could create more tension and force an on-the-spot negotiation or confrontation.
